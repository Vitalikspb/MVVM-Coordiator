# MVVM-Coordiator practice

In this code you can find Architecture MVVM with Coordinator and other stuff which you can use in your project. 

Also I have practice with Coordinator and other. 

Implement some things: 
- MVVM + Coordinator.
- Create child Cooridnator.
- How can pass data to new ViewController. 
- Implement back to previous ViewCOntroller.
- Create own class for TableViewDataSoure.
- Implement closure.

Enjoy it!
